# expense_tracker_js
During the learning phase of Javascript, I am here to construct an expense tracker project based on my Javascript expertise.
I created two input fields for the item name and item price in this cost tracker project. I saved all of the data for the item name and item price in local storage as I can easily manipulate data that is kept there.
One more purpose I save all data to local storage since if I reload the entire HTML webpage, my expense tracker list will not be clean. My purpose is to develop any website with the lowest latency.
